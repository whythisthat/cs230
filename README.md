Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The client was The Gaming Room. They currently had a game called Draw It or Lost It for windows. The Gaming Room wanted to improve the software functionality and to expand to other platforms. I kept this document clear, concise, and to the point.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It helps in keeping your eye on what needs to be done.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Recomendations were hard for me, I had no idea where to start.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took what was needed and made adjustments as needed. All while still keeping the game the same. Your client may ask you to do the work but it is the user's who truely control the product. If they don't trust the software then they won't use it.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I put my focus on clear documentation. which allow easier updates and maintenence.
